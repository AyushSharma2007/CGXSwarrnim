# Topic-1 — Comparison Operators

## Q1. Predict the Output

Predict the output before running the code.

```python
a = 15
b = 20

print(a < b)
print(a > b)
print(a == b)
print(a != b)
print(a <= b)
print(a >= b)
```

---

## Q2. Compare Expressions

Predict the output:

```python
x = 10
y = 10

print(x == y)
print(x != y)
print(x < y)
print(x <= y)
print(x >= y)
```

Pay special attention to the difference between `==` and `=`.

---

## Q3. Comparison with Arithmetic

Predict the output:

```python
a = 10
b = 5

print(a + b == 15)
print(a * b > 40)
print(a - b != 5)
print(a // b == 2)
```

---

## Q4. String Comparison

Predict the output:

```python
print("Python" == "Python")
print("Python" == "python")
print("Hello" != "hello")
```

What does this tell you about string comparison and case sensitivity?

---

# Topic-2 — Assignment Operators

## Q5. Trace the Value

Predict the final value of `x`:

```python
x = 20

x += 10
x -= 5
x *= 2
x //= 5

print(x)
```

Write the value of `x` after each statement.

---

## Q6. Assignment Operator Practice

Start with:

```python
marks = 50
```

Use assignment operators to:

1. Increase marks by `10`
2. Decrease marks by `5`
3. Multiply marks by `2`

Print the final value.

---
